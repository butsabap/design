## Options

### Single Selection

[SCREENSHOT]

For single-item selection, if no significant actions follow, the panel may close immediately, indicated by a checkmark on the selected item. However, when the selection triggers significant actions or the footer has additional elements, the user must intentionally close the panel.

### Multi Selection

[SCREENSHOT]

For multi-item selection, the select panel remains open after each selection, allowing users to choose multiple items before closing the select panel to confirm their choices.

### Groups

Items can be grouped to provide additional context or to visually separate them. Each group can have a title.

### Footer

[SCREENSHOT]

An optional footer at the bottom can include a link or button for additional actions.

### Opening

[SCREENSHOT]

Select panels can be activated via a semantic button, which can be a regular button, icon button, or action menu item. If the button represents the current selection, it must have an associated label, either internally (within the button) or externally (adjacent to the button).

## Import

```js
import {SelectPanel} from '@primer/react'
```

## Props

<ComponentPropsTable componentName="select_panel" />

## Anatomy

[SCREENSHOT]

The select panel consists of three main areas: a header, a scrollable list that can be filtered, and an optional footer:

- **Header**: Includes a title and a close button.
- **Input and List (scrollable)**: The scrollable list contains action list items, which can be either single or multi-select options. The input field allows users to quickly filter the list.
- **Footer**: Can contain an actionable button.

## Best Practices

TBD

## Behavior

The select panel opens when the trigger button is activated by a click, `Enter`, or `Space`.

### Interactions

Focus is initially placed on the input field and the first item in the list, which are connected as one focusable entity. Users can type to filter the list or navigate using `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown`.

### Apply Changes

Closing the select panel applies all changes. It can be closed by clicking the trigger button again, the close button, clicking outside the panel, or pressing the `Esc` key.
