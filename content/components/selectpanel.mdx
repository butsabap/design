## Options

### Single Selection

[SCREENSHOT]

For single-item selection, the panel closes immediately upon selection. The selected item is indicated by a checkmark. Set the `selectionVariant` prop on `ActionList` to `single`.

### Multi Selection

[SCREENSHOT]

For multi-item selection, the panel remains open after each selection, allowing users to choose multiple items before closing the panel to confirm their choices. Selections are visually indicated by faux checkboxes. Set the `selectionVariant` prop on `ActionList` to `multiple`.

### Groups

Items can be grouped to provide additional context or to visually separate them. Each group can have a title for better organization.

### Footer

[SCREENSHOT]

An optional footer at the bottom can include a link or button for additional actions.

### Opening

[SCREENSHOT]

Select panels can be activated via a semantic button, which can be either a regular button or an icon button. If the button represents the current selection, it must have an associated label, either internally (within the button) or externally (adjacent to the button).

## Anatomy

[SCREENSHOT]

The select panel consists of three main areas: a header, a scrollable list that can be filtered, and an optional footer:

- **Header**: Includes a title and a close button.
- **Input and List (scrollable)**: The scrollable list contains action list items, which can be either single or multi-select options. The input field allows users to quickly filter the list.
- **Footer**: Can contain an actionable button.

## Best Practices

### Current Selection

To effectively summarize the current selection, display the selected items at the beginning of the unfiltered list. This behavior should occur when opening the select panel or after users clear the input. Avoid reordering items after selection to prevent disorientation.

### Significant Actions

When the selection triggers significant actions, such as deleting items, use a dialog with declarative buttons instead of the select panel. This ensures users are aware of the consequences of their actions.

## Behavior

The select panel opens when the trigger button is activated by a click, `Enter`, or `Space`.

### Interactions

Focus is initially placed on the input field and the first item in the list, which are connected as one focusable entity. Users can type to filter the list or navigate using `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown`.

### Apply Changes

Closing the select panel applies all changes. It can be closed by clicking the trigger button again, the close button, clicking outside the panel, or pressing the `Esc` key.
